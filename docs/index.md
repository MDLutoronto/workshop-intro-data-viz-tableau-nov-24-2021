# Workshop Recording: Introduction to Data Visualization Using Tableau Desktop (Nov. 24, 2021)

This page provides a video recording of an introductory workshop on using Tableau Desktop for data visualization.

**Workshop Description:**

Data visualization gives us a better understanding of our data and helps us communicate that to others. It has the potential to generate insights, communicate findings, and illustrate evidence. Conversely, a poor visualization can undermine an argument or even mislead the reader.

Through a combination of lecture and demonstrations, this **1\.5\-hour workshop** will introduce you to data visualization using a common data visualization tool, [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop). Participants will create visualizations such as a bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots.

This workshop is designed for those new to data visualization and Tableau Desktop. There are no prerequisites or assumptions of knowledge of math, statistics, or programming.

This is a short, introductory workshop. If you would like to learn more about data visualization, you are encouraged to self\-enroll in our longer, online, self\-paced workshops:
